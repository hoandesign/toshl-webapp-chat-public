# Implementation Plan

## âœ… Completed Tasks

All tasks for the image message rendering feature have been successfully implemented and tested. The implementation includes:

### Core Functionality
- [x] 1. Remove caption requirement for image messages
  - âœ… Modified form submission validation in `ChatInterface.tsx` to allow image-only messages
  - âœ… Updated `useChatLogic.ts` handleFormSubmit to process messages with only images (no text)
  - âœ… Ensured proper message creation when only image is present
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 2. Implement image display in chat messages
  - âœ… Added comprehensive image rendering capability to `MessageRenderer.tsx` with `ImageDisplay` component
  - âœ… Created image display component with proper aspect ratio, sizing, and error handling
  - âœ… Implemented cached image retrieval for display performance with fallback mechanisms
  - âœ… Styled image messages to fit within chat interface design with visual indicators
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Create image caching system for display
  - âœ… Implemented comprehensive browser-based cache for resized images using IndexedDB
  - âœ… Added cache storage and retrieval functions with error handling and validation
  - âœ… Created cache cleanup mechanism with LRU eviction to prevent storage overflow
  - âœ… Store display-optimized versions (800x600, 70% quality) separate from AI-processing versions (1024x1024, 80% quality)
  - _Requirements: 2.2_

- [x] 4. Optimize chat history for AI prompts
  - âœ… Modified `apiHandler.ts` to replace old image messages with "[image]" placeholder
  - âœ… Updated `handleProcessUserRequestApi` to process chat history before sending to Gemini
  - âœ… Ensured only current/new images are sent to AI, not historical ones
  - âœ… Maintained conversation context while excluding old image data
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

### Technical Infrastructure
- [x] 5. Update message type definitions
  - âœ… Extended `Message` interface in `types.ts` to support image display metadata
  - âœ… Added optional fields for cached image URLs, display properties, and metadata
  - âœ… Updated `GeminiChatMessage` processing to handle image placeholders with `hasImagePlaceholder` flag
  - âœ… Ensured type safety across image handling components
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 3.1_

- [x] 6. Implement error handling for image processing
  - âœ… Added comprehensive validation for image file types (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP) and sizes (10MB max)
  - âœ… Created fallback mechanisms for image processing failures with retry options
  - âœ… Implemented user-friendly error messages for image-related issues
  - âœ… Added graceful degradation when cached images are unavailable
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1_

- [x] 7. Add visual indicators for image messages
  - âœ… Created distinct styling for messages containing images with gradient borders and enhanced visual hierarchy
  - âœ… Added comprehensive loading states for image processing and display with animated indicators
  - âœ… Implemented image placeholder while loading or on error with retry functionality
  - âœ… Ensured accessibility compliance with ARIA labels, screen reader descriptions, and keyboard navigation
  - _Requirements: 2.4_

### Quality Assurance
- [x] 8. Test image message flow end-to-end
  - âœ… Created comprehensive test suite with 31 tests across 3 test files
  - âœ… Verified image display in chat interface with various image types and error scenarios
  - âœ… Tested chat history optimization with mixed text and image messages
  - âœ… Validated AI prompt construction with image placeholders and context preservation
  - âœ… Covered all edge cases, error handling, and performance optimization scenarios
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_
